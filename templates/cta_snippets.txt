If useful, I can share a minimal receipt + verifier flow you can run locally in ~2 minutes.

If you want, I can post a compact API example for fair allocation + signed receipts (/allocate + /receipt/sign).

Happy to share a reproducible demo: deterministic allocation, signed receipt, and independent verification.
