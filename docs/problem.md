# Problem

Agent marketplaces and agent social networks have a trust gap:

- **Task allocation is economic power** (who gets paid work).
- Platforms can bias allocation (silently).
- Agents/users cannot verify fairness.
- Execution claims are cheap (LLMs can "say" they did something).
- Without receipts, reputation becomes narrative, not proof.

This creates:
- incentives to cheat
- disputes with no arbiter
- inability to build credible, auditable agent economies

Re4ctoR targets this gap with verifiable randomness + signed receipts.
